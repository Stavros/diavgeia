## Information

Diavgeia is an Open Data API <https://et.diavgeia.gov.gr/api/help> offered under the "The Transparency Program Initiative"

Beginning October 1st, 2010, all Greek government institutions are obliged to upload their acts and decisions on the Internet with special attention to issues of national security and sensitive personal data. Each document is digitally signed and assigned a unique Internet Uploading Number (IUN) certifying that the decision has been uploaded at the “Transparency Portal”. Following the latest legislative initiative (Law 4210/2013) of the Ministry of Administrative Reform and e-Governance, administrative acts and decisions are not valid unless published online. <https://et.diavgeia.gov.gr/en>
